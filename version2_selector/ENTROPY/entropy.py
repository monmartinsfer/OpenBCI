	Suppose given time series is X = [x(1), x(2), ... , x(N)]. We first build
	embedding matrix Em, of dimension (N-M+1)-by-M, such that the i-th row of Em 
	is x(i),x(i+1), ... , x(i+M-1). Hence, the embedding lag and dimension are
	1 and M-1 respectively. Such a matrix can be built by calling pyeeg function 
	as Em = embed_seq(X, 1, M). Then we build matrix Emp, whose only 
	difference with Em is that the length of each embedding sequence is M + 1

	Denote the i-th and j-th row of Em as Em[i] and Em[j]. Their k-th elments 
	are	Em[i][k] and Em[j][k] respectively. The distance between Em[i] and Em[j]
	is defined as 1) the maximum difference of their corresponding scalar 
	components, thus, max(Em[i]-Em[j]), or 2) Euclidean distance. We say two 1-D
	vectors Em[i] and Em[j] *match* in *tolerance* R, if the distance between them 
	is no greater than R, thus, max(Em[i]-Em[j]) <= R. Mostly, the value of R is
	defined as 20% - 30% of standard deviation of X. 

	Pick Em[i] as a template, for all j such that 0 < j < N - M + 1, we can 
	check whether Em[j] matches with Em[i]. Denote the number of Em[j],  
	which is in the range of Em[i], as k[i], which is the i-th element of the 
	vector k. The probability that a random row in Em matches Em[i] is 
	\simga_1^{N-M+1} k[i] / (N - M + 1), thus sum(k)/ (N - M + 1), 
	denoted as Cm[i].

	We repeat the same process on Emp and obtained Cmp[i], but here 0<i<N-M 
	since the length of each sequence in Emp is M + 1.

	The probability that any two embedding sequences in Em match is then 
	sum(Cm)/ (N - M +1 ). We define Phi_m = sum(np.log(Cm)) / (N - M + 1) and
	Phi_mp = sum(np.log(Cmp)) / (N - M ).

	And the ApEn is defined as Phi_m - Phi_mp.

	-----
	
	#. Please be aware that self-match is also counted in ApEn. 
	#. This function now runs very slow. We are still trying to speed it up.
